# Checks Overview

ESGF-QC is built from many **atomic checks**, grouped by category. The plugin just decides which ones to run; each category focuses on a specific aspect of file quality.

---

## Dimension Checks
Verify that required dimensions **exist**, have a **positive/expected size**, and match the declared shapes of variables.

## Variable Checks
Ensure variables are **present**, their **shape matches their dimensions**, and (when bounds are declared) each value lies **within its bounds**.

## Time Checks
Focus on the `time` axis: presence of bounds with the right shape, and **consistency between the time axis and the filenameâ€™s time range**.

## Attribute Checks
Check that mandatory **global and variable attributes** are there, correctly typed/encoded, and their values are valid against regex patterns or controlled vocabularies.

## DRS & Consistency Checks
Validate **filenames and directory paths** and compare with the netcdf file's attributes; verify consistency between attributes like **frequency vs table_id**, `experiment_id`, `institution`, `variant_label`, etc., against project rules/CVs.

#Coming Next
- **Data plausibility checks** (e.g. physical plausible, statisctically meaningful, ...).
- **Dataset-level checks** across multiple files (time continuity, no gaps/overlaps, consistent metadata ).
